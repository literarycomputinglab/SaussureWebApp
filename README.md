The PRIN 2008 project "For a digital edition of Ferdinand de Saussure's manuscripts", 
coordinated by Professor Daniele Gambarara of the Università della Calabria, 
started in October 2010 with the overall objective of creating a Web application 
for studying and editing Ferdinand de Saussure's manuscripts.

The project ended in September 2012.

Participants:

    Università della Calabria;
    Università di Firenze;
    Istituto di Linguistica Computazionale "Antonio Zampolli" - Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (ILC-CNR, Pisa);
    Università di Salerno.

The work was divided into the following stages:

    1 - digitalization of the manuscripts and their edition in TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) format [Università della Calabria and Università di Firenze];
    2 - creation of a text management system allowing the parallel visualization of the manuscripts and the respective digitalized texts, their annotation, 
    their processing, the consultation and query of the corpus of texts, the automatic creation of indices of forms [ILC-CNR];
    3 - creation of an electronic thesaurus-lexicon of the saussurian terminology [ILC-CNR].
